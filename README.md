# ADLxMLDS2017

*	The projects we did in lecture: Application of deep learning in 2017 fall.
*	I got **A+** in this class
*	[Lecture link](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/f106-adl/assignment.html)
##	Projects
###	Sequence_Labeling
*	Using TIMIT mfcc data predicting phone sequence
*	Join the kaggle competition and I got rank 36th/191
*	[Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/hw1-timit)
###	Video_Captioning
*	Implement s2vt model to predict the behavior in video
*	Using attention mechanism improve performance
###	Game_Playing
*	Using reinforcement learning play atari game
*	Deep Q learning model for breakout-v1
*	Gradient policy & A2C model for pong
###	Comics_Generation
*	text to Comics face image
*	Using DCGAN model and conditional GAN
*	I got rank 5th/191
*	Implementing cycle gan for style transfer is our bouns
##	Final Project
###	lf2gym
*	We use our novel model (A3C+) training on 2.5D game (little fighter 2)
*	[We build a fine environment for our agent](https://github.com/elvisyjlin/lf2gym)
*	Our agent well defeats original AI
